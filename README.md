# passwordspraypython
python password spraying script


to use:
example: python passwordspraypython.py -u userfile -f fqdn -p password -a attackurl


    <userfile> - Textfile containing our usernames - "users.txt"
    <fqdn> - Fully qualified domain name associated with the organisation that we are targeting - "lol.vulnerable.com"
    <password> - The password we want to use for our spraying attack - "P4$$W0RD"
    <attackurl> - The URL of the application that supports Windows Authentication - "http://ntlm.lol.vulnerable.com"



just have a username file ready to use with it and the path <replaces this>

SICK!
